## About The Project

This microservice is designed to handle the authentication of users for a streaming application. After users have registered, this service manages the verification of their credentials, including username and password,
to grant access to the platform. It ensures that authentication is secure and efficient, employing industry-standard practices like hashing and salting of passwords.
